        Overview

\nAccidental poisoning by soap products can occur as a result of contact with household cleaning products that contain strong chemicals, such as simple soap and benzalkonium chloride. When these products are swallowed or inhaled they can be highly toxic, and even life-threatening.

\nWhat Causes Accidental Soap Poisoning?

\nPeople can be poisoned by soap or household cleaning products when they are exposed to them for a prolonged period. Often, people do not realize the strength of the products they are using. They may not open the windows for ventilation because they do not realize they are inhaling chemical fumes while cleaning.

\nChildren may accidentally poison themselves if they are left unsupervised and ingest or inhale the soap products.

If you swallowed the soap, there may be pain or swelling in your throat and on your lips and tongue.

\nIf you have been poisoned, you may have low blood pressure or your heart rate may drop rapidly. In serious situations, your heart could collapse from contact with the chemicals. Blood tests may reveal that the acid (pH) level of your blood has changed, which can damage your vital organs. This does not always occur with household soap products, but may happen with poisoning from commercial cleaning products.

You may also experience abdominal pain or have blood in your stool. Depending on the product that you ingested, you may also have burns in your esophagus.

\noxygen
\npain medication
